Tech used:

Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)

JWT for login sessions

React for the frontend

What it does:

Users can register and log in

JWT is used to protect routes

Basic role support (user/admin)

Users can create tasks, view their tasks, and mark them as completed

The React UI is intentionally simple and meant for testing the API quickly

How to run it:

Backend:

Go into the backend folder

Install dependencies

Copy the .env.example file to .env and put your MongoDB URI + JWT secret

Start the server with npm run dev

Frontend:

Go into the frontend folder

Install dependencies

Start the app with npm start

The UI opens on port 3000 and the backend runs on port 5000.
